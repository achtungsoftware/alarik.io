    Name of the bucket to upload to.
    ::

    ::field{name="prefix" type="string"}
    Path prefix for the uploaded file (e.g., `images/2025/`).
    ::
::

## Request Body

Send as `multipart/form-data`:

::field-group
    ::field{name="data" type="file" required}
    The file to upload.
    ::

## Response

    "lastModified": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
    "isFolder": false,
    "versionId": "abc123def456",
    "isLatest": true,
    "isDeleteMarker": false
}
```

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST "{API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/objects?bucket=my-bucket&prefix=images/" \
  -H "X-Access-Key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" \
  -H "X-Secret-Key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -F "data=@photo.jpg"
```

## Versioning Behavior

| Bucket Versioning | Behavior |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Disabled | File is overwritten if it exists |
| Enabled | New version is created |
| Suspended | File is overwritten, existing versions are preserved |

## Errors

| Status | Reason |
| ------ | ------ |
| `400` | Missing `bucket` parameter or empty filename |
| `404` | Bucket not found (or not owned by you) |
