## Versioning Behavior

| Bucket Versioning | Key Type | Behavior |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Disabled | File | Permanently deleted |
| Disabled | Folder | All objects with prefix are permanently deleted |
| Enabled | File | Creates a delete marker (object appears deleted but versions are preserved) |
| Enabled | Folder | All objects with prefix are permanently deleted |
| Suspended | File | Permanently deleted along with all versions |
| Suspended | Folder | All objects with prefix are permanently deleted |

::note
When versioning is enabled, deleting an object creates a delete marker. The object appears deleted, but previous versions can still be accessed. Use the [Delete Version](/docs/internal-api/user/objects/delete-version) endpoint to permanently remove specific versions.
