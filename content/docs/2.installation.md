---

This guide will walk you through getting Alarik up and running on your system. The recommended approach is using Docker, which handles all dependencies and provides a consistent environment across platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10 or later recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

::note
Alarik is in alpha. Prebuilt Docker images and precompiled binaries are not yet available. For now, you'll need to build from source using Docker. Official images on Docker Hub and precompiled binaries will be provided once the project reaches a stable release.
::

## Getting the Source

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achtungsoftware/alarik.git
cd alarik
```

## Building and Running

Alarik provides two Docker Compose configurations: one optimized for production use and one for development with additional debugging features.

::tabs
  ::div{label="Production" icon="i-lucide-rocket"}
  The production configuration is optimized for performance and stability:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up --build -d
  ```

  This builds the Docker image locally and starts Alarik in detached mode. The build process may take a few minutes on first run as it compiles the Swift code.
  ::

  ::div{label="Development" icon="i-lucide-code"}
  The development configuration includes hot reloading, verbose logging, and debug symbols:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
  ```

  Use this when contributing to Alarik or debugging issues. The development build is not optimized and should not be used in production.
  ::
::

Once started, the following services will be available:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| API | `http://localhost:8080` | S3-compatible API endpoint |
| Console | `http://localhost:3000` | Web-based management interface |

## Configuration

Alarik is configured through environment variables. You can set these in a `.env` file in the project root or pass them directly to Docker Compose.

### Required Variables

::field{name="API_BASE_URL" type="string"}
The base URL where the Alarik API is accessible. Used for generating correct URLs in responses.
```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
::

::field{name="CONSOLE_BASE_URL" type="string"}
The base URL where the web console is accessible.
```bash
CONSOLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
::

### Authentication

A default admin user is always created on first startup. You can customize the credentials using these variables:

::field{name="ADMIN_USERNAME" type="string" default="alarik"}
Username for the default admin account.
```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=alarik
```
::

::field{name="ADMIN_PASSWORD" type="string" default="alarik"}
Password for the default admin account.
```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=alarik
```
::

::warning
Change the default admin credentials before deploying to production. The default values are publicly known and should only be used for local development.
::

### S3 Access Keys

You can configure default S3 access keys for the admin account:

::field{name="DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY" type="string"}
Default S3 access key ID.
```bash
DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```
::

::field{name="DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY" type="string"}
Default S3 secret access key.
```bash
DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```
::

::warning
These example keys are from AWS documentation and are publicly known. Always generate unique keys for production environments.
::

### Account Settings

::field{name="ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION" type="boolean" default="false"}
Controls whether users can register new accounts through the console. When disabled, only administrators can create new accounts. This should be disabled in production.
```bash
ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION=false
```
::

### Example .env File

Here's a complete example configuration for local development:

```bash
# API and Console URLs
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
CONSOLE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Admin credentials (change for production!)
ADMIN_USERNAME=alarik
ADMIN_PASSWORD=alarik

# Default S3 keys (change for production!)
DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

# Account settings
ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION=false
```

### Test the API

Using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws s3 --endpoint-url http://localhost:8080 ls
```

Or with curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### Create a Test Bucket

```bash
aws s3 --endpoint-url http://localhost:8080 mb s3://my-first-bucket
```

## Building from Source (Advanced)

If you prefer to build natively without Docker, you'll need Swift 6.2 or later installed on your system.

::warning
Native builds are only supported on **Linux** and **macOS**. Windows users must use Docker.
::

```bash
cd alarik
swift run
```

For the web console (requires Node.js):

```bash
cd console
npm install
npm run dev
```
